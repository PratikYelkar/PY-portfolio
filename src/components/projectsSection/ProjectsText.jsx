        I have applied my skills to build real-world solutions in areas like authentication systems, machine learning workflows, responsive web design, and data analytics. My focus lies in developing full-stack applications that are efficient, secure, and user-friendlyâ€”leveraging technologies like React.js, Node.js, Python, MongoDB, SQL, and more. I strive to write clean, maintainable code while solving real challenges through practical implementation.
